name: loop-init
description: Detect this project's stack, conventions, tracker and git policy, and write loop/PROFILE.md so the loop can run here without any hand-editing. Use once per project when adopting the loop, or when the user says "/loop-init". Also use to re-detect after a project's build or conventions change materially.
model: opus
effort: high
---

Run in the main session. Detect, propose, write the profile, stop. **Never plan a milestone, write a task packet, or touch application code** — `/loop-plan` does the first two and `builder` does the third.

Your entire job is to make every later stage able to work here without reading a single machinery file. If you leave a field guessed where it could have been detected, every downstream agent inherits that guess and acts on it with full confidence.

## 0. Adoption, or re-detection?

**Check this before anything else.**

```
ls loop/PROFILE.md
cat .claude/loop-templates/VERSION
```

**Report the machinery's date every time, in one line.** `.claude/` is a *copy*: it does not update when the template does, and nothing else in the loop will ever mention it. A project can run machinery months old while the user assumes it is current — which has already caused a near-miss, when a fix that prevents data loss was merged upstream and the adopted project still held the version without it.

You cannot check for updates: an adopted project has no pointer back to where it was copied from. So do not try, and do not guess. State the date, and if it is more than a month or two old, say plainly that re-copying `.claude/` from the template is worth doing before relying on this run. If the file is absent, the copy predates version stamping — say that, and treat it as old.

- **Absent** → first adoption. Continue to step 1 and write everything step 7 lists.
- **Present** → **re-detection.** The project has been running the loop. Detect exactly as you would otherwise, but step 7 changes: you rewrite `loop/PROFILE.md` and **nothing else**.

### What re-detection must not touch

`loop/` holds two kinds of file, and only one of them is yours to replace:

| File | On re-detection |
|---|---|
| `loop/PROFILE.md` | **Rewrite** — the changed facts are the whole point |
| `loop/STATE.md` | **Append one entry.** Never rewrite: it is the append-only journal `/retro` reads as evidence |
| `loop/LESSONS.md` | **Leave alone.** It holds lessons this project earned, which no seed file contains |
| `loop/PLAN.md`, `loop/tasks/` | **Leave alone.** They may describe a unit in flight |
| `loop/HANDOFF.md`, `loop/AUDIT.log` | **Leave alone.** Session and run records |

This matters more than it looks. Under the default local footprint `loop/` is in `.git/info/exclude`, so **none of it is in version control and none of it is recoverable.** Re-seeding `LESSONS.md` from the template destroys every earned lesson; rewriting `STATE.md` destroys the history the next `/retro` reasons from. Both would look like success.

### Two things to say out loud

- **Report the profile as a diff, not as a new file.** On a re-run the interesting output is what *changed* — a test gate that went from broken to real, a command that moved, a prerequisite that is now satisfied. Show the before and after for each changed field, and say plainly which facts you could not re-verify.
- **Warn if a unit is in flight.** If `loop/PLAN.md` has unchecked `- [ ] T-00X` tasks, say so before writing: those packets were written against the facts you are about to change, and `/loop-plan` may need to re-derive them. Finishing or re-planning the unit is the user's call, not yours.

Then append to `loop/STATE.md`:

```
## <date> — Re-detected (`/loop-init`)
- Trigger: <what changed — a new dependency, a provisioned service, a toolchain upgrade>
- Fields changed: <field: old → new, one line each, or "none">
- Could not re-verify: <list, or "nothing">
- Unit in flight: <work item ref and unchecked task count, or "none">
```

## 1. Decide the mode

```
git log --oneline -1
```

- Output, and source files present → **brownfield**. Conventions already exist in the code, whether or not anyone wrote them down. Detect them.
- No commits, or no source files → **greenfield**. Nothing to detect. Go to step 6.

If the repo has history but only scaffolding (a generated starter with no real code yet), treat it as greenfield and say so — detecting "conventions" from a framework's `init` output produces confident nonsense.

## 2. Detect commands and prerequisites

Read the build manifest and the CI config together. They are authoritative for **different things**, and conflating them produces a profile that's wrong in a way nobody notices:

- **The manifest is authoritative for the local invocation** — the command an agent should actually run. Record this one.
- **CI is authoritative for which commands must pass, and for what the environment needs.** Its `services:`, `env:` and setup steps are the best available list of prerequisites, usually better than the README's.
- **CI-only flags are not part of the command.** `--coverage`, a verbose or JUnit-XML reporter, `--batch-mode`, `--ci`, `--no-watch`, a fail-fast threshold: these exist for a build server. Do not fold them into the recorded command. Note them in the Evidence column if they matter, and be aware that a reporter flag changes the output shape `test-runner` parses — which is a reason to *avoid* it locally, not to adopt it.
- **A README that disagrees with the manifest is stale.** That's the drift worth reporting.

If CI runs a command the manifest doesn't expose at all, that's a real finding: record the CI form and note that there is no local equivalent.

Look for the build manifest for the stack (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Gemfile`, `*.csproj`, `mix.exs`), then `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Makefile`, `justfile`, `Taskfile.yml`, then the README's build section.

**Find all of them, not the first one.** A repo with a `package.json` for tooling and a `pom.xml` for the application is not a JavaScript project, and picking whichever manifest you found first is a mistake you won't notice until a builder runs the wrong test command. When more than one manifest exists, work out which one builds the code the loop will be changing — CI usually settles it, and if it doesn't, ask. If the project genuinely has two live stacks, record commands for both and say which is the default.

Determine: build, full test suite, **single test file**, **single test case**, lint, type check, run-locally. The two single-test forms matter more than they look — without them, every `test-runner` spawn runs the entire suite, and on a slow suite that is where the loop's time goes.

**Most manifests do not expose a single-test script.** Outside a few build tools, you will find a `test` script and nothing narrower. Do not leave those rows blank, and never fill them with the full-suite command — a profile whose "single test" command runs everything is worse than an empty row, because it looks answered.

Derive them from the **test runner** instead, which you identify from the manifest's dev dependencies or the test files' imports. Then **verify by running** — an unverified single-test invocation is the single most likely thing in this profile to be wrong, because the syntax varies by runner and by version:

- Identify the runner (from `devDependencies`, a test config file, or what the test files import).
- Find its file-selection and name-filter flags. Many runners have both — one to run a path, one to match a test name — but **some genuinely have neither, and a missing flag is a fact to record rather than a gap to paper over.** Karma, for one, has no CLI name filter at all: narrowing to a single case there means `fit`/`fdescribe` in the source. Where a form does not exist, say so in that row and name what the project would do instead. An invented flag is worse than an honest limitation, because the first agent to use it loses a spawn discovering it was never real.
- **If the runner drives a browser, confirm a browser actually exists.** Karma, Vitest browser mode and web-test-runner all launch one, and the machine may not have the default. Find which binary is used and how it is located — usually an env var such as `CHROME_BIN` — and record the full invocation including that variable. A test command that works only because your shell happened to have it set is a command the loop cannot reproduce.
- Run each form once against a real test file from this repo and confirm it executes fewer tests than the full suite. Record the exact invocation that worked, not the one the docs suggest.
- If a package-manager script wrapper needs an argument separator (`npm test -- <args>`), include it in the recorded command — omitting it silently passes the flags to the wrong process.
- **If the project has no tests, these forms cannot be verified.** Record the runner's documented syntax, mark both rows `(assumed)`, and note that they stay unverified until a suite exists. Do not present an unrun command as a detected fact.

**Prerequisites are as important as the commands.** Find what must be true for the suite to pass: a container runtime, a running service, an env file, a seeded database, a compiled native dependency, a specific runtime version. For each, record the check command *and the symptom when it's missing* — a missing prerequisite produces a failure that reads like a code bug, and `test-runner` needs to distinguish them without guessing.

**Find the install step before verifying anything.** On a fresh clone nothing is installed, so every command you try fails with a "command not found" for a tool that is in fact configured correctly. Look for the dependency-install command (from CI's setup steps, which always have one) and record it as a prerequisite. Run it, or ask the user to, before attempting verification. Recording "lint is broken" when the truth is "dependencies aren't installed" writes a confidently wrong profile, and every later agent inherits it.

Then verify by running: the build command, the lint command, and each single-test invocation. Do not run the full suite — it can be slow, and the single-test run already proves the invocation shape.

**When a command fails, classify it before recording it.** These are three different facts and only the last is a project defect:

- **Not installed** — a "command not found" / "not recognized" for a tool the manifest declares. Not a finding. Install and retry.
- **Environment missing** — it ran but couldn't reach a database, port, or credential. Not a finding about the code: this is a **prerequisite**, and it belongs in the Prerequisites list with its symptom.
- **Genuinely broken** — it ran, had what it needed, and failed anyway. This one is a real finding. Record it in Open questions with the actual error, because a project whose documented build doesn't work is exactly what the loop needs to know before a builder blames itself.

Never report a failure without saying which of the three it is. Guessing here is how a prerequisite ends up recorded as a broken build.

### Prove the test gate is real

**The test command is the loop's only automated gate. Establish that it can actually fail before recording it.** A command that always succeeds is worse than no command, because `/orchestrate` treats its exit code as proof and every task sails through.

Run the test command and read what it reports, not just its exit code:

- **How many tests ran?** If the answer is zero, this is not a gate. Several toolchains exit 0 on an empty run with no warning at all — `dotnet test` in a repo with no test project restores, prints nothing about tests, and returns success.
- **Does a test project or test directory exist?** Search for it directly. Do not infer its existence from the test command succeeding.

Record the outcome in the profile as a first-class fact, never as a blank:

- **Real gate** — tests exist and ran. Record the count you observed, as the baseline. **Measure it from a clean state**, and record the command sequence that produced it. Incremental and cached runs under-report: on a real project an incremental build showed 0 warnings where a clean build showed 1, which would have let a "count unchanged" gate pass a regression. A baseline measured off a cache is not a baseline. If a clean run is prohibitively slow, record that the figure is incremental and say so in the same sentence.
- **No test suite** — the project has none. Say so explicitly, in those words, plus what the test command does when run anyway (typically: exits 0 having done nothing). `/orchestrate` reads this and substitutes a different gate; without it, the loop silently verifies nothing.
- **Gate exists but is empty or trivial** — a test project with no meaningful assertions. Treat as "no test suite" and say why.

When there is no test suite, tell the user plainly at step 7 that the loop's verification stage will not be load-bearing until one exists, and recommend making a test harness the first task. That is their call, not yours — but they must make it knowingly, because the failure mode is invisible.

## 2b. Detect how to run and observe the app

The profile's Runtime verification section. `verifier` reads it to exercise a task's acceptance criteria against the running application — the loop's only check that isn't a claim about the tests.

**Decide `applicable` first, and be willing to say no.** A library, a pure CLI with no process to start, or anything with nothing to run gets `applicable: no` plus the reason. A recorded "no" is a real answer; a blank section is a stage that quietly never runs.

If it does apply, find and record: the start command; the **readiness signal** (a health endpoint, a port opening, a log line — never a fixed sleep, which is how a verifier reports a false failure on a slow morning); where to reach it; the stop command; any seed or fixture step; where the app's logs go; and how to confirm a running process is actually current code.

Look in this order — `docker-compose.yml` and `Procfile`, the manifest's run/serve/start script, CI's end-to-end or smoke job if there is one, then the README's "getting started" section. A compose file is usually the best source, because it names the ports, the dependencies and the health checks in one place.

**Verify by starting it once.** Bring the app up, confirm the readiness signal actually fires, reach it, then stop it. An unverified start command is close to useless: `verifier` will report `BLOCKED` on every task and the stage will look broken rather than unconfigured. If it can't be started here — a credential you don't have, a service that isn't reachable — record the commands, mark them `(assumed)`, and list it in Open questions.

### Detect the browser harness, and install nothing

The profile's Browser observation fields. `verifier` has no browser tool — it drives the harness **this project already owns**, through its shell. So this step is detection, never provisioning: do not add Playwright, Cypress or a browser download to a project that hasn't chosen one. That is a decision for the project's own maintainers, and a template that installs a 300MB dependency to satisfy its own verification stage has stopped adapting to the stack and started imposing one.

Look for: `playwright.config.*`, `cypress.config.*`, `wdio.conf.*`, `puppeteer` in the manifest's dev dependencies or in test imports, an `e2e/` or `tests/e2e/` directory, and any CI job that installs browsers (`playwright install`, `cypress run`, a `browser-actions` step).

If you find one, record it and **verify by running a single spec headless**, exactly as you verified the single-test command in step 2 — an unrun browser invocation is at least as likely to be wrong, because the headless flag, the base URL and the "is the app already up?" assumption all vary by harness. Record the invocation that worked.

Then decide `UI-observable criteria`, and be willing to write the unwelcome answer:

- **A harness exists** → `verifier drives the harness above`.
- **The app has no UI** (an API, a CLI, a library, a worker) → `none — this app has no UI`. Clean answer, nothing missing.
- **The app has a UI and there is no harness** → `not verifiable here — no harness, so UI criteria are the user's to confirm`. Say this plainly to the user at step 7: acceptance criteria that need a rendered page will come back `NOT VERIFIED`, which is the honest result rather than a stage quietly passing what it cannot see. Recommend a harness task if they want that closed — their call, like the test harness in step 2.

Never leave these fields blank. A blank one reads downstream as "no UI concerns here", which is the one reading that makes a missing harness invisible.

## 3. Detect conventions

This is the section that decides whether the loop produces code that looks native or code that looks bolted on. Read real files — pick the two or three most recently-changed non-trivial source files plus their tests.

Determine: layering and module boundaries; where each kind of new code goes; how data crosses the boundary to callers; dependency wiring style; error and failure handling; how schema or data-shape changes are made; test placement and naming; what "done" looks like for a change (does a change normally arrive with tests, docs, a changelog entry).

Two rules on how you write these down:

**Cite evidence, never assert.** Each convention gets a `path:line` where the pattern is visible. A reviewer flagging a violation needs to point at the precedent, and a wrong detection needs to be visibly wrong.

**Record how each rule is enforced** — a test, a lint rule, a compiler or schema check, or "convention only, reviewer must catch it". This distinction is the difference between a rule the loop can rely on and a rule the loop must actively police. Mark the unenforced ones: they are where review attention goes.

### Reference existing docs, do not absorb them

If the project already has `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, a style guide, or a decision-record directory, **link to it and summarize what it governs in one line.** Do not copy its rules into the profile. Two copies of a rule drift apart, and then agents follow whichever they read first — the exact failure the loop's own lessons file warns about. If such a doc already covers conventions thoroughly, the profile's conventions section should be mostly pointers.

### Credentials you notice along the way

Detection reads config files, so you will sometimes see hardcoded credentials. Report them in Open questions with the path — do not fix them, do not rotate anything, do not commit. It is the user's call and it is independent of the loop.

**Separate a real secret from a public identifier, because conflating them costs you the reader.** A database password, an API secret, a private key or a service-account JSON is a genuine leak. A Firebase web `apiKey`, a public client ID, or a publishable payment key is **not** — those are designed to ship in every client bundle, and calling them a leak trains the user to discount the finding that mattered. For those, the real question is whether the service's own access rules are locked down; say that instead.

For anything genuinely secret, check whether it is in **git history and pushed**, not merely in the working tree — `git log --oneline --all -- <path>`. That changes the remedy from "edit the file" to "rotate the credential", and only the second one actually helps.

## 4. Detect work-item source and tracker

Establish where work comes from, in this order:

1. Ask what the user actually wants to loop on. Their answer outranks detection — a repo can have GitHub Issues enabled and still receive its real work as Jira tickets or as verbal requests.
2. Check what exists: `gh issue list --limit 3` for GitHub Issues; issue references in recent commit subjects (`ABC-123`, `#123`) to spot an external tracker; a `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory.

Set `source` to exactly one of:

- **`milestone-chain`** — an ordered set of tracked milestones with a consistent body shape. Record how to list them, how the next is chosen, and the required sections.
- **`ticket`** — work arrives as individual tracked items with no guaranteed structure. Record the fetch command. Do not record required sections; there are none.
- **`prompt`** — no tracker item. The user describes the work. Correct for a personal project, a greenfield start, and most single work tasks.

When in doubt choose `prompt`. It is the only source that cannot be wrong, and `/loop-plan` handles the others by fetching *into* the same shape anyway.

## 5. Detect git policy and footprint

```
git log --oneline -20
git symbolic-ref --short HEAD
git ls-files .github/pull_request_template.md .husky .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

Infer the commit message format from what's actually there — if 20 commits show `type: summary`, that's the format; if they show `[ABC-123] summary`, that's the format. Record it as a pattern with a real example.

Then determine whether the loop may commit at all, and the pre-commit gate.

**Branch policy needs establishing, not inferring.** A repo with twenty commits shows you a
naming convention; a repo with one shows you nothing, and "the branch I am standing on" is not
evidence of a policy. This is the field most likely to be filled in by default rather than by
decision, and the default is always `main`.

Set the policy from **where this project's quality gate sits**, and say so in the Evidence line:

- **The gate runs before code lands** — CI that blocks the merge, a reviewer, a human reading each
  change as it happens. Committing to the default branch is defensible, and short-lived branches or
  none at all is a legitimate practice rather than a lapse. Record what the project actually does.
- **The gate runs after code lands** — which is *this loop*, by construction. `/orchestrate` commits
  per task, autonomously, and `security-auditor` reviews the unit's whole change set at close,
  after every one of those commits exists. A finding there needs somewhere to land. On a branch the
  answer is "don't merge"; on the default branch the answer is unpicking a dozen commits.

**So for any project without a blocking pre-merge gate, the default is: never commit to the default
branch.** Observed in a real adopted project: the unit-close audit returned a HIGH finding on both
of its first two units, and both times the reviewing agent's own words were that it would not merge
on that. That sentence needs a branch to be worth anything.

Name the branch `<type>/<slug>`, reusing the **same type vocabulary as the commit message format**
you just recorded — `feat`/`feature`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`. One unit, one
branch. The type describes the *unit*, not the commits inside it: a `fix/` unit may well contain a
`test:` commit. Recording only `feature/<slug>` is the common error, and it goes wrong the first
time a unit is a remediation rather than a feature — which for this loop is often the second unit,
since it is what the first unit's security audit produces.

Bootstrapping is the exception worth stating: the first commit, the scaffolding, `git init` itself.
Branching there is friction with nothing to protect. The policy starts mattering the moment
`/orchestrate` begins committing on its own.

**Ask about footprint explicitly, in a shared repo:** should loop files be committed, or stay local? Default to local for any repo with other contributors — teammates seeing unexplained agent config in a PR is a real cost. Local means adding the loop paths to `.git/info/exclude`, which is per-clone and never committed, so the shared `.gitignore` is untouched.

## 5b. Establish the milestone-close gates

`/orchestrate` walks the profile's Milestone-close gates after the last task of a unit. **If you leave that section as template placeholders, it walks a list of placeholders and every gate silently never runs** — and the one people notice missing last is the security review, because nothing fails when it is skipped.

Propose a concrete list. Start from what the project already has, then fill the gaps:

- **Security scanning.** `/orchestrate` always spawns `security-auditor` at the close of a unit, so you do not record that here — it is built in. What you are looking for is the project's own scanner: a SAST or dependency step in CI (`codeql`, `semgrep`, `snyk`, `trivy`, `bandit`, `npm audit`, `dependency-check`), or a documented process. Record the command if one exists. The two are complementary rather than redundant — a scanner knows published vulnerabilities and pattern signatures, the auditor knows what the unit was trying to do — so having one is not a reason to skip the other. If the project has no scanner, record `none` rather than inventing one.
- **Closing the work item.** From the tracker detected in step 4, if any. Mark it as requiring user confirmation.
- **Anything the project's own process already requires** at a release or merge boundary — a changelog entry, a version bump, a migration check, a manual smoke test. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the PR template for these rather than inventing them.

Two rules on how you write them, both from the template:

- **A gate is a command or a human action, never a skill.** `/orchestrate` runs these from inside its own invocation; listing `/retro` or `/loop-plan` there asks it to invoke a skill mid-skill. `/retro` is what the user runs after `/orchestrate` returns.
- **A gate with neither a command nor a named owner is a gate that never runs.** Prefix the user's ones with `USER:` so the distinction survives.

If the user wants no gates at all, record that explicitly — `none — the user closes milestones manually` — rather than leaving placeholders. An empty section and a deliberately empty section look identical six weeks later.

## 6. Greenfield: write a provisional profile instead

Nothing to detect, so ask for the minimum and mark everything provisional.

Ask only what blocks the first task: what is being built and in what language/stack; whether a project skeleton exists yet or the loop's first task creates it; how they want to be told what to build (almost always `prompt`); and whether this repo will have other contributors.

Then write the profile with:

- Commands filled in from the stack's conventional defaults, each marked `(assumed)`.
- Conventions **left open** — one line saying they get filled in as decisions are made. Do not invent a layering rule for code that doesn't exist. An invented convention becomes a constraint that fights the project's real shape a week later.
- `source: prompt`.
- Git policy: no commits until the user asks, since there is no history to infer a format from.
- Open questions listing every assumed field.

Say plainly which fields are assumed and that the first `/retro` should revisit them. A greenfield profile is a starting position, not a specification.

## 7. Propose, then write

Show the user the profile you're about to write — the detected facts with their evidence, the assumptions clearly separated, and the open questions. Get confirmation before writing anything.

Lead with the things most likely to be wrong: any command you couldn't verify, any convention detected from a single example, and the work-item source.

**If step 0 said re-detection, write `loop/PROFILE.md` and the `STATE.md` entry only, then skip to step 7b.** Items 2 to 5 below are first-adoption only. Writing any of them on a re-run destroys earned state that is not in version control and cannot be recovered.

Then write (first adoption):

1. `loop/PROFILE.md` — filled in from `.claude/loop-templates/PROFILE.template.md`.
2. `loop/LESSONS.md` — copy `.claude/loop-templates/LESSONS.seed.md` verbatim. Do not edit the seeded lessons to match this stack; they are stack-independent by construction, and `/retro` retires any that prove inapplicable.
3. `loop/PLAN.md` — a stub saying no work item is loaded and to run `/loop-plan`.
4. `loop/STATE.md` — a header line and an adoption entry (date, mode, detected stack, work-item source).
5. `loop/tasks/README.md` — copy `.claude/loop-templates/tasks-README.md`.
6. If footprint is local, **check what is already tracked before excluding anything**:

   ```
   git ls-files .claude loop
   ```

   Exclusion applies only to untracked paths. If this prints anything, adding those paths to `.git/info/exclude` does nothing to them — and per this template's own README, any project you have used Claude Code in already has a tracked `.claude/`, so this is the common case rather than the edge one.

   - **Nothing tracked** → append `loop/` and `.claude/` to `.git/info/exclude` — but **read the file first and append only what is missing.** Someone may have set this up before running you, and a second copy of an entry is confusing rather than harmful, which is exactly why it survives. `grep -c` for each path before writing it.
   - **Something tracked** → say so plainly and give the user the two real options: `git rm --cached -r <path>` to untrack it (a deletion in everyone else's next pull, so it is their call), or accept a committed footprint for those paths. Do not write the exclusion and report success.

   Then verify **every** path you claimed to exclude, not just one:

   ```
   git check-ignore -v loop/PLAN.md .claude/settings.json
   git status --short
   ```

   `git status --short` must come back clean. Probing `loop/PLAN.md` alone passes happily while `.claude/` sits exposed in the diff a teammate reviews — the precise failure the local footprint exists to prevent.

   If footprint is **committed**, exclude `loop/AUDIT.log` specifically. It is machine-local run telemetry that changes on every spawn; committing it produces conflict-prone churn in every PR and tells a teammate nothing.

## 7b. Check the hooks can run

Nothing to install, and no settings file is touched. Three hooks ship, all declared in frontmatter:

- **`SubagentStop`** — each loop agent declares it as a `Stop` hook, which Claude Code converts and unregisters when the agent finishes. Appends one line to `loop/AUDIT.log` per spawn, giving `/retro` a record no agent can shape.
- **`Stop`** — `/orchestrate` declares the loop guard, which warns the user when a task is over its spawn budget, blocked, or at its final attempt. Advisory; it never blocks stopping.
- **`PreCompact`** — `/orchestrate` declares the checkpoint writer, which writes `loop/HANDOFF.md` from durable state before context is compacted.

The last two register when `/orchestrate` is invoked and stay registered for that session. Set the profile's **Loop budgets** section while you are here — the guard falls back to 10 spawns per task if the field is missing, which is a reasonable default but not this project's answer.

Two things to confirm here, because both fail silently:

- **`jq` or `python3` must be on PATH** — `command -v jq python3`. The script reads the hook payload with one of them and exits quietly with neither, producing an empty log that looks exactly like "nothing has run yet". If neither is present, say so now and tell the user the loop still works, just without the audit trail.
- **On Windows, check for Git Bash — not for `sh` on the Windows `PATH`.** Claude Code runs a hook `command` through bash by default, and falls back to PowerShell on Windows only when Git Bash is *not installed*. So the question that decides whether the shipped `sh` command works is "is Git Bash present", and the two answers come apart: on a stock Windows machine `sh` is absent from the Windows `PATH` while Git Bash is installed and `sh` resolves fine inside the shell the hook actually runs in. Testing the `PATH` sends the user through a pointless multi-file edit.

  Check with `git --exec-path` — if it resolves under a Git installation, Git Bash is there and the default `sh` commands need no change. On a Windows machine with no Git Bash, hooks run under PowerShell, so point every one of them at its `.ps1` twin. Each script has one, and the argument shape differs:

  ```
  powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/audit-subagent.ps1" -AgentName <agent>
  powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/loop-guard.ps1"
  powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/precompact-checkpoint.ps1"
  ```

  Derive the file list rather than recalling it — `grep -rl 'hooks/' .claude/agents .claude/skills` — because editing all but one leaves a hook silently pointing at a shell that will not run it, and a partial audit log looks identical to a partial run. This is the one sanctioned edit to a machinery file, because it is platform-specific rather than project-specific.

  Never write bare `bash` into a hook command on Windows: it resolves to the WSL stub in `WindowsApps`, which fails with `execvpe(/bin/bash) failed` when no distro is installed — or worse, succeeds against a completely different view of the filesystem.

Then tell the user to check `loop/AUDIT.log` has content after their first `/orchestrate` run. A wrong interpreter path fails silently and looks identical to an empty log.

**If you smoke-test a hook, build the payload with a real JSON writer, not by hand-escaping quotes in a shell string.** A malformed fixture produces exactly the same symptom as a broken hook — silence and exit 0 — and the conclusion you will reach is that the machinery is at fault. This happened on the loop's first adoption and came one step from a permanent edit to a shared machinery file.

**The `.ps1` repoint above is the only sanctioned edit to anything in `.claude/`.** If a hook still appears broken after a valid payload, that is a defect in the template and belongs upstream as an issue — not a local patch. A per-project fix to machinery forfeits every later improvement, silently, and is invisible to the next person who adopts the template.

## 8. Stop

**On first adoption**, report: the mode, the stack, the work-item source, anything you could not determine, and any command that failed verification. Tell the user to skim `loop/PROFILE.md` — particularly the conventions section, since that is what shapes every line of code the loop writes — and then run `/loop-governance` to complete the required implementation gate. Planning remains available while governance is pending.

**On re-detection**, report something different, because the file is not new:

- **What changed, field by field** — old value → new value. This is the output that matters; a re-run whose report reads like a fresh adoption tells the user nothing about what moved.
- **What you could not re-verify**, and why. A command that verified on adoption and cannot now is a finding, not a blank.
- **Which files you left untouched**, named explicitly — `loop/STATE.md`, `loop/LESSONS.md`, `loop/PLAN.md`, `loop/tasks/`. Say it plainly: the user has no version-controlled copy under the default footprint, so "I did not overwrite your journal" is worth one line.
- **Whether a unit is in flight**, and that its packets were written against the previous facts.

Then tell them to re-read the changed fields specifically, and to consider whether an in-flight unit needs re-planning before `/orchestrate` continues.

Do not continue into planning, even if the user's original request was to start building. The profile is a checkpoint worth a human glance precisely because everything downstream depends on it.


## Required next workflow

Require Python 3.11+ for the governance validator in both integrations. After
initialization, the next required step is loop-governance, not implementation.
If loop/GOVERNANCE.json is absent, report governance pending; never assume older
installations are exempt. Preserve existing governance records and summaries on
re-detection. Changed profile/workflow evidence requires reassessment. Planning
remains available, but orchestration and publication require the executable gate.
